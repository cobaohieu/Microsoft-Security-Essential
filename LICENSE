MICROSOFT SECURITY ESSENTIALS
These license terms are an agreement between Microsoft Corporation (or based on where you live, one of its affiliates) and you. Please read them. They apply to the software named above, which includes the media on which you received it, if any. The terms also apply to any Microsoft

subsequent version of the software (including any updates or supplements)

updates,

supplements,

Internet-based services, and

support services

for this software, unless other terms accompany those items. If so, those terms apply.

By using the software, you accept these terms. If you don't accept them, do not use the software.

As described below, installation or use of the software also operates as your consent to the transmission of certain standard computer information during validation, automatic download and installation of certain updates, and for Internet-based services.

If you comply with these license terms, you have the rights below.

1. INSTALLATION AND USE RIGHTS.

Home Use. If you are a home user, then you may install and use any number of copies of the software on your personal devices for use by people who reside in your household.

Small Business. If you operate a small business, then you may install and use the software on up to ten (10) devices in your business.

Restrictions. The software may not be used on devices owned by government or academic institutions.

Separation of Components. The components of the software are licensed as a single unit. You may not separate the components and install them on different devices.

Included Microsoft Programs. The software may contain other Microsoft programs. The license terms with those programs apply to your use of them.

2. INTERNET-BASED SERVICES. Microsoft provides Internet-based services with the software. It may change or cancel them at any time.

Consent for Internet-Based Services. The software features described below and in the Microsoft Security Essentials Privacy Statement connect to Microsoft or service provider computer systems over the Internet. In some cases, you will not receive a separate notice when they connect. In some cases, you may switch off these features or not use them. For more information about these features, see http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=148744. By using these features, you consent to the transmission of this information. Microsoft does not use the information to identify or contact you.

1. Computer Information. The following features use Internet protocols, which send to the appropriate systems computer information, such as your Internet protocol address, the type of operating system, browser and name and version of the software you are using, and the language code of the device where you installed the software. Microsoft uses this information to make the Internet-based services available to you.

Updates. By default, the software will automatically download definition updates. For more information, see the privacy statement at http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=148744.

Malicious Software Removal. The software will check for and remove certain high severity malicious software ("Malware") stored on your device during scheduled scans and when you select this action. When the software checks your device for Malware, a report will be sent to Microsoft about any Malware detected or errors that occur while the software is checking for Malware, specific information relating to the detection, errors that occurred while the software was checking for Malware, and other information about your device that will help us improve this and other Microsoft products and services. No information that can be used to identify you is included in the report.

Potentially Unwanted Software. The software will search your computer for low to medium severity Malware, including but not limited to, spyware, and other potentially unwanted software ("Potentially Unwanted Software"). The software will only remove or disable low to medium severity Potentially Unwanted Software if you agree. Removing or disabling this Potentially Unwanted Software may cause other software on your computer to stop working, and it may cause you to breach a license to use other software on your computer, if the other software installed this Potentially Unwanted Software on your computer as a condition of your use of the other software. You should read the license agreements for other software before authorizing the removal of this Potentially Unwanted Software. By using this software, it is possible that you or the system will also remove or disable software that is not Potentially Unwanted Software

Microsoft Active Protection Service (MAPS) Participation. The Microsoft Active Protection Service (MAPS) antimalware community is a voluntary, worldwide community that includes Microsoft Security Essentials users. Upon initial installation, users will be opted-in by default to participate in MAPS under a Basic membership. Under the Basic membership, if the software is turned on, MAPS can report information about Malware and other forms of Potentially Unwanted Software to Microsoft. If a MAPS report includes details about Malware or Potentially Unwanted Software that the software may be able to remove, MAPS will download the latest signature to address it. MAPS can also find "false positives" (where something originally identified as Malware turns out not to be) and fix them. In some instances, personal information might unintentionally be sent to Microsoft. However, Microsoft will not use this information to identify you or contact you. To learn more about MAPS and the information this feature transmits to Microsoft, see the privacy statement at http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=148744.

Error Reports. This software automatically sends error reports to Microsoft that describe which software components had errors. No files or memory dumps will be sent unless you choose to send them. For more information about Error Reports, see http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=148744.

Windows Update; Microsoft Update. The software turns on automatic updating from Windows Update and Microsoft Update. To enable the proper functioning of the Windows Update and Microsoft Update service in the software, updates or downloads to the Windows Update and/or Microsoft Update service will be required from time to time and downloaded and installed without further notice to you.

2. Use of Information. We may use the computer information, error reports, CEIP information, and Malware reports, to improve our software and services. We may also share it with others, such as hardware and software vendors. They may use the information to improve how their products run with Microsoft software.

11. LEGAL EFFECT. This agreement describes certain legal rights. You may have other rights under the laws of your country. You may also have rights with respect to the party from whom you acquired the software. This agreement doesn't change your rights under the laws of your country if the laws of your country don't permit it to do so.

 12. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY.The software is licensed “as-is.” You bear the risk of using it. Microsoft gives no express warranties, guarantees or conditions. You may have additional consumer rights under your local laws which this agreement cannot change. To the extent permitted under your local laws, Microsoft excludes the implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose and non-infringement. FOR AUSTRALIA ONLY: You have statutory guarantees under the Australian Consumer Law and nothing in these terms is intended to affect those rights.

LIMITATION ON AND EXCLUSION OF REMEDIES AND DAMAGES. You can recover from Microsoft and its suppliers only direct damages up to U.S. $5.00. You can't recover any other damages, including consequential, lost profits, special, indirect or incidental damages.
This limitation applies to 

anything related to the software, services, content (including code) on third party Internet sites, or third party programs; and

claims for breach of contract, breach of warranty, guarantee or condition, strict liability, negligence, or other tort to the extent permitted by applicable law.

It also applies even if Microsoft knew or should have known about the possibility of the damages. The above limitation or exclusion may not apply to you because your country may not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental, consequential or other damages.
